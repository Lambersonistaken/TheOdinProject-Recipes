        <h2>Description</h2>
        <br>
        <p>T-bone Steak is one of the best steak cuts and includes a T-shaped bone with meat on each side. Searing in the pan at high temperature and finishing in the oven produces a caramelized crust with juicy meat in the middle. T-bone is a quick and flavorful steak dinner with no marinating required!

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Stir the salt, paprika, black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, coriander, and turmeric together in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li>Rub the steaks on all sides with the seasoning mixture. Cook on the preheated grill to your desired degree of doneness, 3 to 3 1/2 minutes per side for medium-rare. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C).</li>
