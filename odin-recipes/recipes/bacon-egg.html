        <h2>Description</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Whether you’re on a low carb or Keto diet, or you need something quick to grab while running out of the door, Breakfast Egg Muffins are a delicious healthy saviour and PERFECT for Meal Prep! Although eggs are a preferred and versatile breakfast food, not many of us have the time to whip up a Caprese frittata, a steaming pan of Shakshuka, or poached eggs on toast and omelettes in the morning.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>12 slices bacon</li>
            <li>10 eggs</li>
            <li>¼ cup milk</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped green onion</li>
            <li>¼ cup diced roasted red pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Prepare 12 muffin cups with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Arrange bacon on a microwave-safe plate. Cook bacon in microwave for 75 seconds.</li>
            <li>Place a slice of bacon into each muffin cup so that the bacon lines the edges of the cup.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs and milk together in a bowl; ladle into muffin cups. Top 4 of the egg portions with 1 tablespoon each of the green onion, 4 with 1 tablespoon each jalapeno pepper, and 4 each with 1 tablespoon roasted red pepper.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until only slightly moist on top, about 20 minutes. Season the muffins with salt and pepper; top with Cheddar cheese. Continue baking until the cheese melts, about 5 minutes more.</li>
        </ol>
